This powershell script will cleanup the following directories:

C:\Windows\Temp\*

C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Local\Microsoft\Windows\InetCache\Content.IE5

C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\*\Cache

C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Temp


The wildcards mean, any directory matching the line will be cleaned. 

Feel free to update the code as seen fit, but this is what roughly i have produced from research, trial and error.
